What's this?
------------

  This application is used to forward MIDI messages between
  local MIDI applications and Nintendo DS handhelds in the
  local network. For more information, visit:

         http://dsmi.tobw.net


Usage
-----

  - (If you're on Windows, install a MIDI loopback like LoopBe)
  - Get some DSMI applications and put them on your DS
  - Start your favorite MIDI application
  - Start the DSMIDIWiFi server
  - Start jamming!


Troubleshooting
---------------

  Normally, the server should just work(TM). You don't
  need to configure anything.

  However, if there are problems, you can start the
  DSMIDIWiFi Server from the command line. Then, you
  should see some output if the server is receiving data.
  For other hints, refer to the FAQ section on the
  homepage.
